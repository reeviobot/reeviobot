	<h1>Jamie Reeve</h1>
	<h3>Pithy sub-title</h3>
	<p>Hopefully you landed on this page with positive intentions. If not, whatever you are grumpy about i'm sure i was just making an ill-timed joke. Forgive me.</p>

	<p>This site was originally intended to park my "name" domain while I thought of something more useful to do with it. Then I realised that any other project I work on with have it's own URL, so this one can really only be about me.</p>

	<p>Therefore it's going to be short and sweet. A smattering of life facts alongside a predictably infrequent blog of random ramblings</p>
